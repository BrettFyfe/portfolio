  <p> I am good at HTML, CSS, and know some python. I also know how to work android studio at a decently high level with the help of the almighty google, and the language Java. I like to play video games in my spare time or watch youtube videos, sometimes about tech related things. I am very interested in becoming a software developer, as it is fun to solve the puzzles they present me with and I like computers as a whole. </p>
